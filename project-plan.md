# Project Plan

## Summary

This data science project aims to compare the public transport systems in Nuremberg and Wrocław. We will analyze the type of vehicles used in each city's public transport system and determine which city has better connectivity for travel.


## Rationale

Comparing the public transport systems of two cities can provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each system. By analyzing the type of vehicles used and the connectivity between different modes of transport, we can identify areas where improvements are needed and recommend solutions to enhance the public transport system.

## Work Packages

1. Clean and explore data: Clean data from the two data sources, ensuring they are in a compatible format and explore the data to gain insights on the public transport systems in Nuremberg and Wrocław.

2. Type of vehicles comparison: Compare the type of vehicles used in the public transport systems of Nuremberg and Wrocław, including buses, trams, and trains.

3. Connectivity analysis: Analyze the connectivity of the public transport systems in Nuremberg and Wrocław, including the number of transfers required to reach a destination and the travel time between different locations.
 
4. Insights and recommendations: Provide insights and recommendations on which city has a better public transport system and how each system can be improved based on the analysis and comparison.
